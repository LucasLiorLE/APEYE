<<<<<<< HEAD
This is a discord bot with lots of features, useful for all kinds of servers!
It is able to moderate servers, have some fun features like an EXP system just like mee6!
> [!WARNING]
> The bot is still currently under development, expect bugs, and some features not here yet.[^1]

Types of commands that will come later include:
1. Economy commands[^2]
2. Image/video editing (Other than convert)[^3]
3. More useful API commands
4. More convert options, converting media.

Current, the bot has these types of commands:
1. Moderation commands
    * Has basic moderation features like `/kick`, `/ban`, `/mute`, etc.
    * Has some more advanced features like `/modstats`, `/modlogs`, and the purge commands.
> [!TIP]
> Using `>clean`[^6] is a lot faster than `/clean`! It is the only one that uses prefixes.[^4]

2. Fun commands
    * `/dog`, `/cat`, `/joke`, etc.
    * `/memeify` command group to create memes!
    * `/say` and `/dm` for moderators!

3. Utility commands
    * `/hypixel`, `/minecraft`, `/roblox`, and a lot more of these types of commands allow you to view data for a certain game.
    * `/convert` group allows you to convert a picture of video to a different format. 
    * `/cgloves` for roblox slap battle enjoyers!
    * A lot of informative commands like `/avatar` group, `/serverinfo`, `/userinfo`, and `/roleinfo` allows you to view info about it!
> [!TIP]
> You can connect your accounts via `/roblox connect`, `/cr connect`, etc.[^5]

Some of it's other features include:
1. An EXP system
    * Similar to mee6, but there is a global and server leaderboard.
    * You can use `/mlevel` to calculate how long it will take for you to achieve a level!

2. `/afk` command
    * Kind of like Dyno and Maki's AFK, but combined!
    * Sets [AFK] next to your name, sends an embed if someone pings you, and also waves!

[^1]: Also, I currently am a singular developer so don't expect me to be able to test everything.
[^2]: Don't expect these to come soon. Developing an entire economy command and stuff takes a very long time!
[^3]: Probably will use cobalt.tools, if they include a public API. I heard they don't but I wanna double check some other stuff.
[^4]: More will hopefully come soon!
[^5]: A lot of it is not done. Some might not be added as it's not neccessary.
[^6]: Currently using an alternative method. Try not to use it much until I fix it.

> [!WARNING]  
> Moderation commands will be updated in the future. The file locations might change, so don't use it as a moderation bot until it is finished.

3. Memeify command group
    * Just make a bunch of memes, some uses API. More commands will be added in the future
  
4. Convert command group
    * Convert uses PIL and moviepy to convert images and videos into different formats. Also allows you to download youtube videos
    * Under development, but more will formats will be added later on
> [!WARNING]
