# APEYE
APEYE is a discord bot that has a lot of utilities including:
1. Moderation commands
    * Currently not fully done, expect it to be slow/have errors.
    * Basic moderation commands like kick, ban, mute, etc
    * Also has some more like `/modstats` and `/modlogs` 
> [!WARNING]  
> Moderation commands will be updated in the future. The file locations might change, so don't use it as a moderation bot until it is finished.

2. Roblox, Clash royale, and Geometry dash API commands
    * Uses `/roblox (command)`, `/cr (command)`, and `/gd (command)`. 
    * Roblox commands allows you to view player data like description, avatar, etc
    * Clash royale commands allows you to view a player/clan data
    * Geometry dash commands allows you to view a certain player's data
> [!TIP]
> You can connect your accounts via `/roblox connect` or `/cr connect`. `/gd connect`[^1] is currently not done.

3. Memeify command group
    * Just make a bunch of memes, some uses API. More commands will be added in the future
  
4. Convert command group
    * Convert uses PIL and moviepy to convert images and videos into different formats. Also allows you to download youtube videos
    * Under development, but more will formats will be added later on
> [!WARNING]  
> These commands (especially `/convert youtube`) is CPU intensive.

[^1]: Hopefully coming next release! Easy to make, but so much I can do.
